#### Supported Formats (only one is needed per game)

##### GBE fork achievement JSON Format

By default they are stored in: `%AppData%\GSE Saves\{AppID}`
Your `achievements.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "Defeat_Mantis": {
    "earned": true,
    "earned_time": 1754144765
  },
  "Obtain_Archetype": {
    "earned": true,
    "earned_time": 1754144765
  }
}
```

##### Steam cached Achievement Watcher {AppID}.db files

By default they are stored in: `%AppData%\Achievement Watcher\steam_cache\data`
and/or `%AppData%\Achievement Watcher\steam_cache\user\{SteamID}\`
A **Steam** label will be added automatically to these types of games.

Your `{AppID}.db` should look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "apiname": "ACHIEVEMENT_reached_speed_1",
    "achieved": 0,
    "unlocktime": 0
  },
  {
    "apiname": "ACHIEVEMENT_spam_obstacles",
    "achieved": 0,
    "unlocktime": 0
  }
]
```

The only important thing in the user branch below is the AppID folder, inside that the game's Steam AppID folder, inside that "Your achievement data".
All other files are optional or auto-generated.

These are detected automatically from your repository URL!

## 📊 What You Need vs What's Optional

### Required (Minimum Setup):

✅ Supported achievement data file in `AppID/[Steam AppID]/` with your unlocked achievement data
✅ GitHub Pages enabled

### Optional (Enhanced Features):

⭐ You can see all optional files in the "AppID/_appid_" folder in this main branch. (remove .example from them and use them as it is written inside them)

## 📝 Notes

- Your GitHub Pages site is public by default
- No personal Steam account needed - just upload your achievement files
- The viewer works offline after initial load

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**No games showing?**

- Check that your `AppID/*/` folder has any supported format achievement data files as mentioned in the [Supported Formats](https://github.com/Roschach96/achievement-viewer/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-formats-only-one-is-needed-per-game) section.
- Verify the files are valid (use a json or db etc. validator, depending on the file)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)

**Games show but no names/icons?**

- Most likely Steam is using another Steam AppID for that game.
(Example: for Dishonored the correct Steam AppID is 205100, because 217980 somehow doesn't work. You can check these things with SteamDB, you can check there if there are multiple AppIDs if you enter the game's name)

**Profile picture not showing?**

- Falls back to default Steam logo if GitHub avatar unavailable
- Check that your GitHub profile is public

**Workflow not running?**

- Verify the workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/fetch-game-data.yml`
- Check Actions tab for error messages

Implemented and automatized the logic behind **alex47exe**'s gse_fork_tools for hidden achievement retrieval.

Credit goes to **darktakayanagi** for the enhanced hidden achievement retrieval.
